In this folder ('examples'):
1. 'peach'
   - contains a single _PNG_, so, the *folder* name will be used as the emote name.
2. 'peanutbutterjellytime'
   - contains a single  _GIF_, so, the *folder* name will be used as the emote name.
3. 'hearts'
   - contains multiple images, so, _each image filename_ is used as an emote name.

If you're still confused, try running `run_examples.bat` in the root folder to see a sample output.
